# AdventOfCode2020

Solutions for some of the puzzles from [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/). I will likely not have the time necessary to complete all of them, but am hoping to complete some of them when I can find the time. 

All of these solutions will be in Elixir and can be run via a mix task.

Puzzle solutions are located in the `lib/mix/tasks` directory and data files / puzzle inputs are located in the `data_files` directory. Files will be named after their associated puzzle from the Advent of Code website.

Solution explanations and instructions on how to run each solution are located in the `solution_explanations` directory.

## Installation
